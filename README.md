## ✅ Goal
This App analyzes WhatsApp group chat messages or individual chat, and obviously anyone with a WhatsApp account
can make use of the app to analyze their chat.


## ✅ How to Export your file
Let me briefly walk you through on how to export your chat file. 
- Firstly, open whatsApp group chat or individual chat. 
- Go to __"More"__ and make sure to export without media in a text format. 
- Thats it! Your file is ready for analysis. :wink:

## ✅ Insights
The insights derived from your chat data can be done for both group wise and individual wise. such as; __total letter count__, __word count__, 
__total messages sent to the group__, __total emojis__ and __total media sent to the group__, and __sentiment in messages__ both for group wise and individual wise.
When a person is mostly available for chat by __date stat, time stat, weekday stat and time series messages (messages sent as time move on)__
You can also analyse for the most used word or emoji in a chart distribution, in the group or by an individual and the most active person in the group.
