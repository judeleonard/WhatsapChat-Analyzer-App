## ✅ Insights Derived From App
The insights derived from your chat data can be done for both group wise and individual wise. such as; __total letter count__, __word count__, 
__total messages sent to the group__, __total emojis__ and __total media sent to the group__ and as well for individual wise.
When a person is mostly available for chat by __date stat, time stat, weekday stat and time series messages (messages sent as time move on)__
You can also analyse for the most used word or emoji in a chart distribution, in the group or by an individual and the most active person in the group.
